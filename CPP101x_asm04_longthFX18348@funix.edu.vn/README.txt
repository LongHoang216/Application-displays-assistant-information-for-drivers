					*************** DESCRIPTION ******************
PROJECT NAME: APPLICATION DISPLAYS ASSISTANT DRIVER INFORMATION

*INTRODUCTION: 

Imagine, you are the driver, and to control a car you have to control the gear lever and vehicle speed, as well as set several functions that serve to make driving safer:

This application develops a driver notification assistance program. Here are the main functions:

1. Login feature. This function is equivalent to unlocking the car and starting the engine.

2. Control the gear speed (simulation). (R: Backward/N:Pause/D:Forward/P: Parking)

Number P: Return the car to parking mode. In this mode, the gearbox will be in P mode and the wheels will be locked

Number N: Also bring the car to parking mode. The only difference from the P number is that the wheel is not locked, if the brakes are not used, the car will drift

Number R: The car will move backward

Number D: The car will move forward

3. Warning drivers about the safe distance at some speed ranges (User can set for each speed range)

4. Warning whenever vehicle's velocity exceeds acceptable range in D and R gear.

5. Display information at each change

6. Turn off the vehicle (option).

*REQUIREMENT: VISUAL STUDIO IDE 2022

*HOW TO USE: 

- Set the default password for the vehicle if required

- Enter the password to unlock the vehicle (if the password matches the one that is saved in the program, the vehicle will start)

*Note: If the input contains letters, the program will announce and the user has to enter again.

- Set 3 different level speeds for safe distance warning

- Change gears
